# Sentry-on-ARM64

## [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry) build that fully supports ARM64 architecture.

> **This build is not intended to run in production and no support is provided.** It may preform worse than official x86 version and may fail in any time. However all of the features that were tested personally are functional and working.
